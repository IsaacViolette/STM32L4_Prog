PRELAB QUESTIONS:

1. What assembly language instruction is used to call a function in ARM Thumb2 assembly?

ANSWER:
The assembly language instruction to call a function in ARM Thumb2 assembly is bl (branch-and-link). This stores the value of the next instruction link-register so we can return to the right place after completed.

2. What assembly language instruction is used to return from a function in ARM Thumb2 assembly?

ANSWER:
The assembly language instruction to return from a function in Thumb2 assembly is bx. This returns to the callsite.

3. With the standard ARM EABI, what register is used to pass a single 32-bit integer argument to a
function?

ANSWER:
The register that is used to pass a 32-bit integer is r0. 

4. If your function is not a leaf function (meaning it calls another function) what must you do with your
link register (LR) before calling the other function?

ANSWER:

If the function is not a leaf function, you must pop the link register before using bx to return to the previous function
