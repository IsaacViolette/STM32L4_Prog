Post Lab Questions:

How close is the delay to 1s?

It's almost exact based off the picture from lab. Maybe a few microseconds off.

What is the percent error?

The percent error is well below 1%.

I wasn't able to get the exact period of the clock pulse as the picture that was sent to 
me didn't measure it directly and I couldn't do it by eye, so ia assumed it was a few microseconds off.

Question 1: What is the address of the interrupt vector that points to the SysTick handler?

ANSWER: From page 242 from the textbook, the address is 0x0000003C.

Question 2: Suppose a 16MHz clock is used to drive the timer. What is the maximum interval between two
interrupts that we could obtain?

ANSWER: Max of 24 bits so

((2^24)-1)/16000000 = 1.0485 seconds
