Lab 10: ADC

Something Cool: Read value of ADC DR register to the LCD screen using infared transmitter and receiver.



Post Lab:
1. 
	a. The potentiometer at half, output voltage:
		1.747 V

	b. Value of ADC DR register:
		2258
	c. Calculate the reference voltage 
		3.3 V / 4096 = 805 uV
		
		2258 * 805 uV = 1.819 V
		
		It is 70 mV off which doesn't seem to be too bad, I might've moved something a bit when using the multimeter on the output of
		the potentiometer.
